# SignBank+: Preparing a Multilingual Sign Language  Dataset\\for Machine Translation Using Large Language Models

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11566)

The [SignBank](https://www.signbank.org/signpuddle/) dataset is a collection of SignWriting examples, contributed by the
community.
It is a great resource for SignWriting, but it is not immediately fit for machine translation.
It includes SignWriting entries with text that is not parallel, or multiple terms where only some of them are parallel.
For example, it includes a chapter and page number for a book, but not the text, or a word and its definition.

## Data

### Files

This repository includes the `data` directory, which includes:

- [`raw.csv`](data/raw.csv) - The raw SignBank dataset (until June 2023).
- [`manually-cleaned.csv`](data/manually-cleaned.csv) - A manually cleaned subset of the raw dataset.
- [`bible.csv`](data/bible.csv) - Automatically aligned data from the Bible for puddles 151 and 152.
- [`gpt-3.5-cleaned.csv`](data/gpt-3.5-cleaned.csv) - A cleaned subset of the raw dataset, using GPT-3.5 Turbo (June
  13).
- [`gpt-3.5-expanded.csv`](data/gpt-3.5-expanded.csv) - Expansion of the cleaned dataset, filtered to the source
  language.
- [`gpt-3.5-expanded.en.csv`](data/gpt-3.5-expanded.csv) - Expansion of the cleaned dataset, with English terms.
- [`benchmark.csv`](data/benchmark.csv) - Small subset of data manually annotated and automatically cleaned in various
  ways.
- [`fingerspelling/*.txt`](data/fingerspelling) - Includes fingerspellings for various languages. `fingerspelling.py` is
  used to generate fingerspelling from words (see [`fingerspelling.csv`](data/fingerspelling.csv)).
- [`signsuisse.csv`](data/signsuisse.csv) - Automatically aligned data from the French Sign Language of Switzerland
  dictionary and SignBank.
- [`sign2mint.csv`](data/sign2mint.csv) - Extra German Sign Language SignWriting data from Sign2Mint.

### Notes:

- To separate between terms, we use the `á›«` (`U+16EB`) character.
- `\n` characters are escaped as `\\n`.

## Fingerspelling

Using the [`fingerspelling`](signbank_plus/signwriting/fingerspelling.py) script, you can generate
SignWriting fingerspelling from words. This is useful for generating data for fingerspelling translation.
The [`fingerspelling_faker`](signbank_plus/signwriting/fingerspelling_faker.py) script generates
synthetic fingerspelling data for machine translation.

## Machine Translation

Using the [signbank_plus/prep_nmt.py](signbank_plus/prep_nmt.py) script, we can prepare the data for
machine translation training, in the [data/parallel](data/parallel) directory.

The [signbank_plus/nmt](signbank_plus/nmt) directory includes scripts for training and evaluating
machine translation systems, like [Fairseq](signbank_plus/nmt/fairseq),
[Sockeye](signbank_plus/nmt/sockeye), [OpenNMT](signbank_plus/nmt/opennmt), and [mT5](signbank_plus/nmt/mt5).

Machine translation benchmarks are available in our paper.

TODO: benchmark machine translation when permuting the signwriting components.

## Benchmarking Cleaning

Using the [`benchmark.csv`](data/benchmark.csv) file,
we benchmark with [signbank_plus/score_benchmark.py](signbank_plus/score_benchmark.py),
to get a measure of how good various automatically cleaning methods are.

The results at the moment are:

| Method                            | IoU   | Average Tokens |
|-----------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| E0: texts                         | 0.497 | 0.0            |
| E1: pred_rules                    | 0.533 | 0.0            |
| E2: pred_general                  | 0.627 | 541.4          |
| E3: pred_specific_5               | 0.712 | 521.4          |
| E4: pred_general_specific_5       | 0.735 | 714.6          |
| E5: pred_general_specific_5_gpt_4 | 0.801 | 713.2          |

GPT-4 is better than GPT-3.5 Turbo, but is also much more expensive.

There are possible improvements to the cleaning, such as using a better model, or better prompt.
